## Overview
The Credit Scoring Model is designed to predict whether a credit applicant is "Good" or "Bad" in terms of creditworthiness based on various financial inputs. The `credit_scoring.py` script provides a graphical interface for inputting applicant data and receiving predictions.

## Files
- `credit_scoring.py`: The GUI application where users can enter data and receive predictions on creditworthiness.
- `train_model.py`: Script for training the credit scoring model. It reads data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, trains a model, and saves the model for later use.
- `credit_data.csv`: The dataset used to train the model (make sure this file is in the same directory as `train_model.py`).

## Installation
